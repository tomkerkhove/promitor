Promitor provides a basic health endpoint that indicates the state of the scraper.

Health endpoints can be useful for monitoring the scraper, running sanity tests
after deployments or use it for sending liveness / health probes.

## Consuming the health endpoint

You can check the status with a simple `GET`:

```shell
‚ùØ curl -i -X GET "http://<uri>/api/v1/health"
```

Health is currently indicated via the HTTP response status:

- `200 OK` - The scraper is healthy
- `503 Service Unavailable` - The scraper is unhealthy

The endpoint provides more details on integration with following dependencies:

- **Promitor Resource Discovery** (when configured)
