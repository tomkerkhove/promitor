version: Scraper - v1.6.1

- {{% tag fixed %}} Ensure scraping jobs have unique names to ensure all resources are scraped
- {{% tag fixed %}} Service Bus queue metrics are not reported correctly for entities in same namespace ([#1050](https://github.com/tomkerkhove/promitor/issues/1050))
- {{% tag fixed %}} `ratelimit_arm` reported instead of `promitor_ratelimit_arm` for Prometheus sink ([#1056](https://github.com/tomkerkhove/promitor/issues/1056))
- {{% tag fixed %}} Runtime config for metrics sinks is not working correctly ([#1052](https://github.com/tomkerkhove/promitor/issues/1052))
- {{% tag removed %}} Default Prometheus configuration since we have multiple metric sinks nowadays. We are removing
 this since you cannot have duplicate Prometheus scraping endpoints. If you omit legacy configuration it will use
  `/metrics` as a default value which forces you to use different endpoint in the Prometheus metric sink.
