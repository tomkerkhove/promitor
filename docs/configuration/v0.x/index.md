Here is an overview of how you can configure Promitor.

## Runtime

The Promitor runtime is flexible and allows you to configure it to meet your needs:

- **PROMITOR_HTTP_PORT** - Defines the port to serve HTTP traffic _(default 80)_

## Scraping

Promitor automatically scrapes Azure Monitor and makes the information available
based on the metrics configuration.

The behavior of this can be configured with the following environment variables:

- **PROMITOR_CONFIGURATION_PATH** - Defines the location of the YAML file that
  declares what Azure Monitor metrics to scrape. If nothing is specified,
  `/config/metrics-declaration.yaml` will be used.
- **PROMITOR_SCRAPE_BASEPATH** - Controls the path where the scraping endpoint
  for Prometheus is being exposed. If nothing is specified, `/metrics` will be used.

We're also providing feature flags to opt-out of certain features:

- **PROMITOR_FEATURE_METRICSTIMESTAMP** - Defines whether or not a timestamp
  should be included when the value was scraped on Azure Monitor. Supported
  values are `True` to opt-in & `False` to opt-out, if nothing is configured
  this will be turned on.

## Logging

We provide insights in how our runtime is doing and is written to `stdout`.

This can be controlled via the following environment variables:

- **PROMITOR_LOGGING_MINIMUMLEVEL** - Defines the minimum log level that should
  be logged. If none is configured, `Warning` will be used. Allowed values are
  `Trace`, `Debug`, `Information`, `Warning`, `Error`, `Critical`, `None` ordered
  from most to least verbose.

### External Providers

Promitor can send telemetry to Azure Application Insights when there is a need to.

It currently supports:

- Exceptions during scraping

In order to enable this feature, the following environment variables need to be provided:

- **PROMITOR_TELEMETRY_INSTRUMENTATIONKEY** - Defines the instrumentation key to
  use when sending telemetry to Azure Application Insights
