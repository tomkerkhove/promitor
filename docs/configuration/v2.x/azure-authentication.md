title: Authentication with Microsoft Azure
---

This document describes the various agents that Promitor provides, what Microsoft Azure services they are consuming and
 what the minimal required permissions are that every entity requires to be functional.

## Overview

Here is an overview of our Promitor agents and their integrations:

| Azure Integration    | Promitor Scraper | Promitor Resource Discovery |
|:---------------------|:----------------:|:---------------------------:|
| Azure Monitor        | ✅               | ❌                         |
| Azure Resource Graph | ❌               | ✅                         |

Each agent needs an Azure AD identity to authenticate with to Microsoft Azure.

In order to achieve this, you'll need to [create an Azure AD Application](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/active-directory/develop/howto-create-service-principal-portal#create-an-azure-active-directory-application),

## Supported Authentication Mechanisms

Our agents provide the following authentication mechanisms:

- **Service principle** - Use application id & secret of the Azure AD entity that has been pre-created to authenticate with
- **Managed Identity** - Use zero-secret authentication by letting Microsoft handle the authentication for you ([docs](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/active-directory/managed-identities-azure-resources/overview))

For details how to configure the authentication, we recommend reading our agent configuration documentation.

### Service Principle Authentication

![Availability Badge](https://img.shields.io/badge/Available%20Starting-v0.1-green.svg)

Every agent needs to be configured with the following environment variables:

- **PROMITOR_AUTH_APPKEY** - Secret of the Azure AD entity to authenticate with

### Managed Identity Authentication

When using Managed Identity, you can use one of the following scenarios:

- **System-assigned Managed Identity** - Use the identity of the Azure resource on which it runs and let Azure handle
 the authentication.
- **User-assigned Managed Identity** - Use a pre-created Azure AD identity but let Azure handle the authentication for you

## Permission Overview

### Required permissions for Azure Monitor

Identities that are used to integrate with Azure Monitor need to have `Monitoring Reader` permission on the
subscription, resource group and/or resources that will be queried.

More information can be found [here](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/monitoring-and-diagnostics/monitoring-roles-permissions-security).

### Required permissions for Azure Resource Graph

Identities that are used to integrate with Azure Resource Graph need to have `Reader` permission on the
subscription, resource group and/or resources that will be queried.

> ⚠ If you are re-using this identity to integrate with Azure Monitor, make sure to grant the required permissions
 to reflect that as well.

More information can be found [here](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/governance/resource-graph/overview#permissions-in-azure-resource-graph).
