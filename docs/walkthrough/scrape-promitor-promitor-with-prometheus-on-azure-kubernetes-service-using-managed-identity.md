## Introduction

This walkthrough will allow you to deploy a full AKS cluster and connect your Prometheus instance to Azure Monitoring through Promitor,
without having to manage and secure any sensitive password.

This walkthrough is almost the same as [Deploying Promitor, Prometheus, and Grafana on an AKS Cluster](/scrape-promitor-with-prometheus-on-azure-kubernetes-service)
but using a **managed identity** instead of a **service principal**.  
AKS requires an identity to create additional resources (like load balancers, disks ...)

- Using a Service Principal requires you to provide an application id and an application key (password).
- Using a Managed Identity requires you to create the identity on Azure, but you don't need to provide any password.

Check the official Microsoft documentation about [Managed Identity in Azure Kubernetes Service](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/aks/use-managed-identity).

We will use the [aad-pod-identity](https://azure.github.io/aad-pod-identity/) project to configure identities for all your cluster pods,
and rely on it for **Promitor**.

## Prerequisites

- [Azure CLI](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/cli/azure/install-azure-cli?view=azure-cli-latest),
to be able to deploy resources through the command line.
- [kubectl](https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/tools/install-kubectl/), the Kubernetes
  command-line tool. It can also be installed via the Azure CLI with `az aks install-cli`.
- [Helm](https://helm.sh/docs/using_helm/#installing-the-helm-client), a Kubernetes
  deployment manager.
- [WSL](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wsl/), if you are using a Windows machine to deploy your whole solution.

## Deploy Azure Infrastructure

### Preparing script

Since we are going to use a lot of bash scripts with different variables values,
it can be a good idea to parameterize everything.
So far, we can start by **exporting** all the values we need:

```bash
# SUBSCRIPTION_ID represents the Azure subscription id you will use to access your Azure resources
export SUBSCRIPTION_ID=<guid-subscription-id>
# LOCATION represents the location where your cluster will be deployed
export LOCATION=northeurope
# CLUSTER_NAME represents the name of your AKS Cluster
export CLUSTER_NAME=PromitorCluster
# RG_NAME represents the resource groupe name where your cluster will be deployed
export RG_NAME=PromitorWithManagedIdentityRG
# AD_POD_IDENTITY_NAME represents the name of your future configured aad-pod-identity. Be careful, should be lower case alphanumeric characters, '-' or '.'
export AD_POD_IDENTITY_NAME=promitor-identity


# As an example, we are going to use a service bus from where we want to grab some metrics, through Promitor
# SERVICE_BUS_NAMESPACE represents the name of you service bus namespace. 
# Be careful as Service Bus Namespaces need to be globally unique.
export SERVICE_BUS_NAMESPACE=PromitorUniqueNameServiceBus

# SERVICE_BUS_QUEUE represents the name of you service bus queue. 
export SERVICE_BUS_QUEUE=demo_queue
```

### Create a Resource Group

```bash
az group create --name $RG_NAME --location $LOCATION
```

Output:

```json
{
  "id": "/subscriptions/<guid-subscription-id>/resourceGroups/PromitorWithManagedIdentityRG",
  "...": "..."
}
```

### Create a Service Bus Namespace and Queue

First we'll need to create a namespace. This **Service Bus Namespace** will output insights into Azure Monitoring.  
These insights will be exposed to **Prometheus** through **Promitor**.  

_Consider this deployment as an example of an Azure resource we want to track from Prometheus._

```bash
az servicebus namespace create \
  --resource-group $RG_NAME \
  --name $SERVICE_BUS_NAMESPACE \
  --location $LOCATION
```

We'll then create a queue in that namespace:

```bash
az servicebus queue create \
  --resource-group $RG_NAME \
  --namespace-name $SERVICE_BUS_NAMESPACE \
  --name $SERVICE_BUS_QUEUE
```

### Create an AKS Cluster

Create an AKS cluster using the managed identity option:

```bash
az aks create --resource-group $RG_NAME \
    --name $CLUSTER_NAME \
    --generate-ssh-keys \
    --node-count 1 \
    --enable-managed-identity
```

A successful cluster creation using managed identities contains this service principal profile information:

```bash
"servicePrincipalProfile": {
    "clientId": "msi"
  }
```

## Cluster Setup

### Get credentials

Getting the credentials from your AKS cluster will allow you to use the `kubectl` CLI, locally.  
You can get your cluster's credentials using this command:

```bash
az aks get-credentials \
  --name $CLUSTER_NAME \
  --resource-group $RG_NAME
```

This will save these credentials to your kubeconfig file and set your new cluster
as your current context for all `kubectl` commands.

Verify your credentials and check that your cluster is up and running with
`kubectl get nodes`.

### Get AKS Managed Identity and MC resource group

To be able to configure **aad-pod-identity**, we will need some information from your newly deployed **AKS** cluster:

- **MC Resource Group**: Resource group where the AKS internal resources have been deployed
- **AKS Managed Identity Id**: AKS Managed Identity created internally (since we used the `--enable-managed-identity` option) that is used by your AKS cluster to access Azure resources.

```bash
echo "Retrieving MC resource group"
export mc_aks_group=$(az aks show -g $RG_NAME -n $CLUSTER_NAME --query nodeResourceGroup -otsv)

echo "Retrieving cluster identity ID, which will be used for role assignment"
export mc_aks_mi_id="$(az aks show -g ${RG_NAME} -n ${CLUSTER_NAME} --query identityProfile.kubeletidentity.clientId -otsv)"
```

## AAD Pod Identity

### Configure AKS Managed Identity for AAD Pod Identity

If you want to know more about how to configure and manage your aad pod identities, check the official documentation: <https://azure.github.io/aad-pod-identity/docs/>

In this walkthrough we are going to configure the **AKS Managed Identity** to allow **aad-pod-identity** to access required resources. (More info: [AAD Pod Identity Role Assignements](https://azure.github.io/aad-pod-identity/docs/getting-started/role-assignment/#performing-role-assignments))

```bash
echo "Assigning role needed by Pod Identity:"
echo "Assigning 'Managed Identity Operator' role to ${mc_aks_mi_id} on resource group ${mc_aks_group}"
az role assignment create --role "Managed Identity Operator" --assignee "${mc_aks_mi_id}" --scope "/subscriptions/${SUBSCRIPTION_ID}/resourcegroups/${mc_aks_group}"

echo "Assigning 'Virtual Machine Contributor' role to ${mc_aks_mi_id} on resource group ${mc_aks_group}"
az role assignment create --role "Virtual Machine Contributor" --assignee "${mc_aks_mi_id}" --scope "/subscriptions/${SUBSCRIPTION_ID}/resourcegroups/${mc_aks_group}"

echo "Assigning 'Managed Identity Operator' role to ${mc_aks_mi_id} on resource group ${RG_NAME}"
az role assignment create --role "Managed Identity Operator" --assignee "${mc_aks_mi_id}" --scope "/subscriptions/${SUBSCRIPTION_ID}/resourcegroups/${RG_NAME}"
```

### Install AAD Pod Identity

To deploy AAD Pod Identity, we need to add the chart:

```bash
echo "Add helm repo for aad pod identity"
helm repo add aad-pod-identity https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Azure/aad-pod-identity/master/charts
helm repo update
```

Then we are good to go to deploy the chart:

```bash
echo "Install aad pod identity and allow use of kubenet"
helm install aad-pod-identity aad-pod-identity/aad-pod-identity --set nmi.allowNetworkPluginKubenet=true
```

### Create the Managed Identity for Promitor

We can basically use the already deployed and created managed identity used by AKS, but since we want to [separate the concerns](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Separation_of_concerns),
we are going to create a new managed identity that will be the identity used later by all your Pods.

```bash
echo "Create identity $AD_POD_IDENTITY_NAME in resource group $RG_NAME"
az identity create -g ${RG_NAME} -n ${AD_POD_IDENTITY_NAME}
```

This identity will be used by **Promitor** to access **Azure Monitoring**.  
So far, we need to allow this identity to read data from **Azure Monitoring** through **RBAC Roles Assignements**:

> _**Warning:**_ It can take some times before the Identity is correctly propagated in Azure Active Directory.  
> So far if you encountered an error where the identity is not found, please wait 60 sec and retry

```bash
echo "Getting Azure Identity used by aad pod identity"
export AD_POD_IDENTITY_CLIENT_ID=$(az identity show -g ${RG_NAME} -n ${AD_POD_IDENTITY_NAME} --query "clientId" -o tsv)
export AD_POD_IDENTITY_RESOURCE_ID=$(az identity show -g ${RG_NAME} -n ${AD_POD_IDENTITY_NAME} --query "id" -o tsv)

echo "Assign role 'Monitoring Reader' to identity $AD_POD_IDENTITY_NAME in resource group $RG_NAME"
az role assignment create --role "Monitoring Reader" --scope "/subscriptions/$SUBSCRIPTION_ID/resourceGroups/$RG_NAME" --assignee "${AD_POD_IDENTITY_CLIENT_ID}"
```

_Note:_ You can check the role assignements using this command:

```bash
az role assignment list --assignee $AD_POD_IDENTITY_CLIENT_ID -g $RG_NAME | jq -r '.[].roleDefinitionName'
```

### Bind your Managed Identity to your Pods, through AAD Pod Identity

The Managed Identity is created, AAD Pod Identity is deployed, it's time to bind your identity to your Pods:

```bash
echo "Create an AzureIdentity in the AKS cluster that references the identity $AD_POD_IDENTITY_NAME"

cat <<EOF | kubectl apply -f -
apiVersion: "aadpodidentity.k8s.io/v1"
kind: AzureIdentity
metadata:
  name: ${AD_POD_IDENTITY_NAME}
spec:
  type: 0 # 0 - user assigned MSI, 1 - service principal
  resourceID: ${AD_POD_IDENTITY_RESOURCE_ID}
  clientID: ${AD_POD_IDENTITY_CLIENT_ID}
EOF


echo "Create an AzureIdentityBinding that reference the AzureIdentity created"

cat <<EOF | kubectl apply -f -
apiVersion: "aadpodidentity.k8s.io/v1"
kind: AzureIdentityBinding
metadata:
  name: ${AD_POD_IDENTITY_NAME}-binding
spec:
  azureIdentity: ${AD_POD_IDENTITY_NAME}
  selector: ${AD_POD_IDENTITY_NAME}
EOF
```

_Note:_ You can check the AAD Pod Identity deployed bindings, using this command:

```bash
kubectl get azureidentity
kubectl get azureidentitybinding
```

### Optional: Check your AAD Pod Identity Installation

Before going further, you can check if your AAD Pod Identity is deployed and configured correctly:

```bash
echo "If you want to test the binding of identity, use this command"
kubectl run azure-cli -it --image=mcr.microsoft.com/azure-cli --labels=aadpodidbinding=$AD_POD_IDENTITY_NAME /bin/bash
```

> _**Warning:**_ It can take some times to Aad Pod Identity to bind the identity to your deployed container.
> If you encountered an error, relaunch the `az login -i --debug` command after 60 sec.

```bash
# Once you are log in the container, and have the bash command line available, try to login using the Managed Identity:
If you don t see a command prompt, try pressing enter.
bash-5.0# az login -i --debug
# You should have a line with 'MSI: token was retrieved. Now trying to initialize local accounts'"
```

If your Azure CLI container is able to retrieve some information from Azure
without having to log in with your credentials,
it means the CLI is using your Managed Identity, through the Pod Identity Binding.

You may have a result indicating you are log in, using a **System Assigned Identity**

```json
"user": {
    "assignedIdentityInfo": "MSI",
    "name": "systemAssignedIdentity",
}
```

## Deploy Promitor and Prometheus

### Create a metrics declaration for Promitor

Before deploying Promitor, you'll need a values file with the managed identity option & a metric declaration
file (these can also be the same file for ease of use).  
The yaml below will scrape
one metric, queue length, from the queue created above.

```yaml
azureAuthentication:
  mode: SystemAssigneManagedIdentity
  identity:
    binding: <aad-pod-identity-name>
azureMetadata:
  tenantId: <guid-tenant-id>
  subscriptionId: <guid-subscription-id>
  resourceGroupName: <promitor-resource-group-id>
metricDefaults:
  aggregation:
    interval: 00:05:00
  scraping:
    schedule: "* * * * *"
metrics:
  - name: demo_queue_size
    description: "Amount of active messages of the 'demo_queue' queue"
    resourceType: ServiceBusNamespace
    azureMetricConfiguration:
      metricName: ActiveMessages
      aggregation:
        type: Total
    resources:
      - namespace: <service-bus-namespace>
        queueName: <service-bus-queue>
```

### Deploy Promitor to your cluster using Helm

To deploy, we'll first add the Promitor chart repository to helm:

```bash
helm repo add promitor https://charts.promitor.io/
helm repo update
```

With this repository added, we can deploy Promitor:

```bash
helm install promitor-agent-scraper promitor/promitor-agent-scraper \
  --values your/path/to/metric-declaration.yaml
```

### Optional: Check your Promitor deployment

You can check that Promitor is getting insights from you service bus, using the managed identity, with this commands:

```bash
# Get promitor pod
export POD_NAME=$(kubectl get pods --namespace default -l "app.kubernetes.io/instance=promitor-agent-scraper" -o jsonpath="{.items[0].metadata.name}")

kubectl port-forward --namespace default $POD_NAME 8080:88
```

Now browse to the address <http://127.0.0.1:8080/metrics> and check your metrics are scrapped:

``` html
# HELP demo_queue_size Amount of active messages of the 'demo_queue' queue
# TYPE demo_queue_size gauge
demo_queue_size{resource_group="ammdocs",subscription_id="xxxxx-xxxxx-xxxxx-xxxxxx-xxxxx",resource_uri="subscriptions/xxxxx-xxxxx-xxxxx-xxxxxx-xxxxx/resourceGroups/YOUR_RESOURCE_GROUP_NAME/providers/Microsoft.ServiceBus/namespaces/YOUR_SERVICE_BUS_NAMESPACE",instance_name="INSTANCE_NAME",entity_name="YOUR_SERVICE_BUS_QUEUE"} 0 1612952581417
```

### Install Prometheus, Grafana and Prometheus Operator

We are going to use the [prometheus-community stack chart](https://github.com/prometheus-community/helm-charts/tree/main/charts/kube-prometheus-stack) from the [Prometheus Monitoring Community](https://github.com/prometheus-community) to deploy a full Prometheus environment, already configured for Kubernetes.

``` bash
helm repo add prometheus-community https://prometheus-community.github.io/helm-charts
helm repo update
```

```bash
cat > promitor-scrape-config.yaml <<EOF
prometheus:
  prometheusSpec:
    additionalScrapeConfigs:
      - job_name: promitor-agent-scraper
        metrics_path: /metrics
        static_configs:
          - targets:
            - promitor-agent-scraper.default.svc.cluster.local:8888
EOF
helm install prometheus prometheus-community/kube-prometheus-stack -f promitor-scrape-config.yaml
```

## Test and check output

You can refer to the [Test and check output](scrape-promitor-with-prometheus-on-azure-kubernetes-service#test-and-check-output) from the first walkthrough to check and test your deployed solution.

## Delete resources

To delete all the resources used in this tutorial, run `az group delete --name $RG_NAME`.
