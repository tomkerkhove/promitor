title: Deploying Promitor
---

Here is an overview of how you can deploy Promitor. 

_For more information about advanced configuration, read our documentation [here](/configuration)._

# Docker

```
❯ docker run -d -p 8999:80 -e PROMITOR_AUTH_APPID='<azure-ad-app-id>'   \
                           -e PROMITOR_AUTH_APPKEY='<azure-ad-app-key>' \
                           -v C:/Promitor/metrics-declaration.yaml:/config/metrics-declaration.yaml \ 
                           tomkerkhove/promitor-scraper
```

# Kubernetes
We currently provide [a helm chart](https://github.com/tomkerkhove/promitor/tree/master/charts/promitor-scraper) which deploys all the required infrastructure on your Kubernetes cluster.

To use this, you will need to provide parameters [via `--set` or `--values`](https://helm.sh/docs/using_helm/#customizing-the-chart-before-installing). Included here are the values that correspond with the local environment variables. In addition
to these, you will need a metric declaration file as described in [Metric Declaration](/configuration/metrics).

```yaml
azureAuthentication:
  # PROMITOR_AUTH_APPID (Required)
  appId: "<azure-ad-app-id>"
  # PROMITOR_AUTH_APPKEY (Required)
  appKey: "<azure-ad-app-key>"

scrapeConfig:
  # PROMITOR_SCRAPE_BASEPATH (Optional, default is shown)
  path: /prometheus/scrape
  # PROMITOR_FEATURE_METRICSTIMESTAMP (Optional, default is shown)
  timestamp: True

telemetry:
  # PROMITOR_TELEMETRY_INSTRUMENTATIONKEY (Optional)
  appInsightsKey: "<azure-app-insights-key>"
```

Check the [full values file](https://github.com/tomkerkhove/promitor/blob/master/charts/promitor-scraper/values.yaml) to see all configurable values.

If you have a `metric-declaration.yaml` file, you can create a basic deployment with this command:
```
❯ helm install --name promitor-scraper ./charts/promitor-scraper \
               --set azureAuthentication.appId='<azure-ad-app-id>' \
               --set azureAuthentication.appKey='<azure-ad-app-key>' \
               --values /path/to/metric-declaration.yaml
```

# Image Tagging Strategy
Depending on your scenario you might need a different update cadence for Docker dependencies.

We provide a few options by offering multiple Docker tags:

- **latest** - Ideal for experimentation and proof-of-concepts, but not recommended for running production workloads.
- **{major}.{minor}** - Representation of a specific feature set, but will be updated with feature & security patches.
- **{major}.{minor}.{patch}** - Run a specific version of the runtime.
_(Alternative could be to use [image digest pinning](https://docs.docker.com/engine/reference/commandline/pull/#pull-an-image-by-digest-immutable-identifier))_

![Image Tagging Strategy](./../media/deploy-image-tagging-strategy.png)

You can also pin to a specific digest of an image to ensure that you are running the same image across your infrastructure.
However, you will not receive security patches unless you use a tool like [Renovate to keep them up-to-date](https://renovatebot.com/blog/docker-mutable-tags).
