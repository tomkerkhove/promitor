Here is an overview of how you can operate Promitor. 

# Health
Promitor provides a basic health endpoint that indicates the state of the scraper.

Health endpoints can be useful for monitoring the scraper, running sanity tests after deployments or use it for sending liveness / health probes.

## Consuming the health endpoint
You can check the status with a simple `GET`:
```
‚ùØ curl -i -X GET "http://<uri>/api/v1/health"
```

Health is currently indicated via the HTTP response status:
- `200 OK` - The scraper is healthy
- `503 Service Unavailable` - The scraper is unhealthy

In the future, the endpoint will be more advanced by giving detailed status on dependencies as well.
