Promitor is actively maintained and developed with best-effort support.

We do welcome PRs that implement features from our backlog and are always happy
to help you incorporate Promitor in your infrastructure, but do not provide 24/7
support.

Are you having issues or feature requests? Feel free to [let us know](https://github.com/tomkerkhove/promitor/issues/new/choose)!
