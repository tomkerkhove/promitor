# Contributing to Promitor

:+1::tada: First off, thanks for taking the time to contribute! :tada::+1:

## Your First Code Contribution

Unsure where to begin contributing to Atom? You can start by looking through these `beginner` and `help-wanted` issues:

* [Beginner issues](https://github.com/tomkerkhove/promitor/issues?q=is%3Aopen+is%3Aissue+label%3Abeginner) - issues which should only require a few lines of code, and a test or two.
* [Help wanted issues](https://github.com/tomkerkhove/promitor/issues?q=is%3Aopen+is%3Aissue+label%3Ahelp-wanted) - issues which should be a bit more involved than `beginner` issues.

## Pull Requests

* Fill in [the required template](PULL_REQUEST_TEMPLATE.md)
* Always create an issue and discuss changes before sending PRs. This is to avoid wasting your time because it's not part of the roadmap or not as how we would approach it.
* Do not include issue numbers in the PR title
* Include thoughtfully-worded, well-structured OpenAPI specs when appropriate.

## Styleguides
